        <p>
          <b>1.</b> Schedule a call with UUu at <a href="https://calendly.com/uuullc" target='_blank'><b>chat.UUu.vip</b></a> — if you can prove that you're truly a Diamond in the rough, we will immediately get you set up so you can begin working full-time on your passion. <br/>
          <b>2.</b> For our support, we ask for 1% equity in your endeavors. There are no contracts — passing the call means we have full faith in you and we simply ask you to reciprocate with faith in us.<br/>
          <b>3.</b> We will help you set up an LLC and handle everything you need to operate a business — from fundraising to recruiting — so you can just focus on what you do best: your passion. <br/>
