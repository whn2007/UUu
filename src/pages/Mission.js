          <h3>STRIKING GOLD</h3>
          <p>
            Striking gold is unimportant, but if we don't strike gold, Handshake
            will be unable to sustain itself and will die. So, in order to avoid
            that gut-wrenching alternate reality, we will make our best and
            honest effort, not be distracted by all the inevitable wen moon and
            green lambo sentiments, and just focus on doing things with
            integrity. â€” <b> johnnywu/</b>

          <p>
            We think of the last 2 years as Handshake's beta stage, and we're
            prepping for a January 1st, 2024, true, mainnet launch. We will work
            on and implement the solutions to all the learnings we've gathered
            for the last 2 years.

              <p>
                While anyone can be a "Director of Handshake", we ask Namers in
                the NamerCommunity/ to reserve calling themselves Directors
                until they've already taken the lead on an effort that's
                directly contributing to the growth of Handshake.

              <h3>CREATORS</h3>
              <p>
                Creators are Directors who have created something we can use
                with our Handshake names. In other words, they're responsible
                for the literal existence of Handshake.
